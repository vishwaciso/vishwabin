# 🖥️ Chapter 1 – Operating Systems & Linux: A Deep Dive

---

## 📌 1. Introduction
An **Operating System (OS)** is the **core software layer** that manages hardware and software resources, providing a stable environment for applications to run.

**Key Roles:**
- Acts as a **bridge** between user applications and hardware.
- Handles **resource allocation** (CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices).
- Provides **security & access control**.
- Facilitates **user interaction** via CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## 📜 2. History & Evolution of Operating Systems

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1969 | **UNIX** created by Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. |
| 1981 | **MS-DOS** introduced by Microsoft. |
| 1983 | Apple launches **Lisa** (first GUI-based commercial OS). |
| 1991 | **Linux** kernel released by Linus Torvalds. |
| 1995 | **Windows 95** introduces Start Menu and Plug-and-Play. |
| 2001 | **Mac OS X** released (based on UNIX). |
| 2020+ | Cloud-native OS & container-based workloads dominate. |

## 🧠 3. What is an Operating System?

> Think of an OS as a **traffic controller** — ensuring smooth communication between software (cars) and hardware (roads), avoiding "crashes" and managing flow.

**Core Functions:**
1. **Process Management** – Scheduling & multitasking.
2. **Memory Management** – Allocating & freeing RAM.
3. **File System Management** – Organizing storage.
4. **Device Management** – Handling I/O devices via drivers.
5. **Security & User Management** – Authentication, permissions.
6. **Networking** – IP management, packet routing.
7. **System Calls Interface** – API for application-hardware communication.

## 🛠️ 4. Kernel – The Heart of the OS

- **Monolithic Kernel** → Entire OS runs in kernel space (e.g., Linux).
- **Microkernel** → Minimal kernel; most services run in user space (e.g., Minix).
- **Hybrid Kernel** → Combines both approaches (e.g., Windows NT, macOS XNU).

## 🎯 9. Boot Process (Linux Example)

### Steps:
1. **Power On** → BIOS/UEFI firmware initializes.
2. **POST** (Power-On Self-Test) checks hardware.
3. **Boot Loader** (GRUB, LILO) loads the kernel.
4. **Kernel Initialization** → Loads drivers & mounts root filesystem.
5. **Init/Systemd** → Starts essential background services.
6. **User Login** → CLI or GUI session starts.

## 🌐 10. Types of Servers (By OS Role)

| Server Type | OS Example | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Web Server | Linux (Apache/Nginx) | Hosts websites. |
| Database Server | Windows Server, Linux | Stores & processes data. |
| File Server | Windows Server, Samba on Linux | Central file storage. |
| Application Server | Red Hat, Windows Server | Runs enterprise apps. |
| Mail Server | Postfix, Microsoft Exchange | Email handling. |
| DNS Server | BIND (Linux), Windows DNS | Domain resolution. |
