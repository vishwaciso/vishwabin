## 📜 **Chapter 1 – Operating Systems**

### 1️⃣ What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is the software layer that acts as a bridge between **user applications** and **hardware**.

**Analogy:**  
Think of an OS as the **manager of a hotel** – guests (applications) make requests, and the manager ensures the staff (hardware) fulfills them efficiently.

### 2️⃣ OS History & Evolution

| Year | OS Name | Description | Icon |
|------|---------|-------------|------|
| 1969 | **UNIX** | Multi-user, multitasking OS, foundation for Linux and macOS. | 🐚 |
| 1981 | **MS-DOS** | Microsoft's first widely used OS, command-line based. | 💻 |
| 1985 | **Windows 1.0** | First graphical OS from Microsoft. | 🪟 |
| 1991 | **Linux** | Open-source Unix-like OS created by Linus Torvalds. | 🐧 |
| 2001 | **macOS** | Apple's Unix-based OS for Mac computers. | 🍏 |

### 3️⃣ Core Functions of an OS
- **🧠 Process Management** – Schedules and manages processes.
- **💾 Memory Management** – Allocates RAM efficiently.
- **📂 File System Handling** – Manages storage and retrieval of files.
- **🔌 Device Management** – Controls peripherals.
- **🌐 Networking** – Manages network connections and protocols.
- **🔐 Security & Access Control** – Enforces permissions and authentication.

### 4️⃣ Kernel Types

| Kernel Type   | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Monolithic    | All services in one kernel space. | Linux |
| Microkernel   | Minimal services in kernel space; rest in user space. | Minix |
| Hybrid        | Combination of both. | Windows NT, macOS |

### 5️⃣ Types of OS

| Type                  | Example | Use Case |
|-----------------------|---------|----------|
| Batch Processing      | IBM OS/360 | Large mainframes |
| Multi-User            | UNIX, Linux | Servers |
| Real-Time (RTOS)      | VxWorks, QNX | Embedded systems |
| Distributed OS        | Amoeba, Plan 9 | Cluster computing |
| Mobile OS             | Android, iOS | Smartphones |

---

### 6️⃣ Client OS vs Server OS

| Feature | Client OS | Server OS |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Purpose | End-user applications | Host services for clients |
| Examples| Windows 11, macOS | Windows Server, RHEL, Ubuntu Server |
| Optimized For | UI/UX | Performance, scalability |

---

### 7️⃣ Popular Server OS Versions
- **Linux:** Ubuntu Server, CentOS Stream, RHEL, Debian
- **Windows Server:** 2016, 2019, 2022
- **BSD Family:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD

9️⃣ Linux Boot Process (Simplified)
1. BIOS/UEFI → Hardware checks
2. Bootloader (GRUB) → Loads kernel
3. Kernel → Initializes devices
4. Init/Systemd → Starts system services
5. User Login → Shell/GUI ready

🔟 Server Roles
Role	Example Software
Web Server	Apache, Nginx
Database Server	MySQL, PostgreSQL
File Server	Samba, NFS
Mail Server	Postfix, Exim
Application Server	Tomcat, JBoss
📜 Chapter 2 – Linux File System & Commands
1️⃣ What is the Linux File System?

The Linux file system organizes files in a hierarchical structure starting from the root (/).

2️⃣ Linux Directory Tree
/
├── bin      → Essential binaries
├── boot     → Boot loader files
├── dev      → Device files
├── etc      → Configuration files
├── home     → User directories
├── lib      → Shared libraries
├── media    → Removable media
├── opt      → Optional software
├── proc     → Process info
├── root     → Root user home
├── sbin     → System binaries
├── tmp      → Temporary files
├── usr      → User programs
└── var      → Variable data

3️⃣ Important Directories Table
Directory	Purpose	Example
/etc	Config files	/etc/passwd
/var	Logs, mail	/var/log/syslog
/home	User data	/home/user1
/bin	Essential commands	/bin/ls
/sbin	System admin cmds	/sbin/reboot
4️⃣ Linux Command Categories

File Management: ls, cp, mv, rm

Directory Navigation: cd, pwd

Permissions: chmod, chown, umask

Process Management: ps, top, kill

Networking: ping, ifconfig, netstat

Disk Usage: df, du

Package Management: apt, yum, dnf

5️⃣ Permissions Diagram
-rwxr-xr--
| |  |  |
| |  |  └─ Others permissions
| |  └──── Group permissions
| └─────── Owner permissions
└───────── File type

6️⃣ Example Commands Table
Command	Description	Example
ls -l	List files with details	ls -l /etc
chmod 755 file	Change permissions	chmod 755 script.sh
ps aux	Show processes	`ps aux
df -h	Show disk usage	df -h /
