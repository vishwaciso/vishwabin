## ☁️ Cloud as a Collection of Domains
Cloud is made up of multiple **technology domains** that used to be separate before.  
Now, each of these domains exists **inside the cloud** with additional automation, scalability, and managed services.

| Domain | Before Cloud (On-Prem) | In Cloud |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Networking 🌐 | Switches, routers, firewalls | Virtual networks, load balancers, gateways |
| Storage 📦 | NAS, SAN, tapes | S3, Blob Storage, EBS, Cloud Volumes |
| Compute 🖥️ | Physical servers | EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine |
| OS 🐧🪟 | Bare-metal/Linux/Windows servers | Cloud images, serverless OS layers |
| Middleware 🔄 | WebSphere, Tomcat | Managed middleware services |
| Database 🗄️ | Oracle, MySQL on-prem | RDS, Cloud SQL, Cosmos DB |
| Security 🔒 | Firewalls, IDS/IPS | IAM, WAF, security groups |
| DevOps ⚙️ | Jenkins, GitLab | CI/CD pipelines in the cloud |
| Monitoring 📊 | Nagios, Zabbix | CloudWatch, Azure Monitor |
| Backup & DR 💾 | Tape backups, DR sites | Cloud backup services |
| AI/ML 🤖 | On-prem GPU clusters | SageMaker, Vertex AI |
| FinOps 💰 | IT cost optimization | Cloud cost management |
