# ☁️ Cloud Computing Career Roadmap & Domain Guide

## 🌟 Introduction
Cloud computing is **not just a single technology**—it is a **collection of domains** working together to deliver on-demand computing resources over the internet.  
It’s like a giant ecosystem where each domain plays a specific role—**networking, compute, storage, security, databases, DevOps, AI/ML, and more**—to provide services you can pay for on a **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** model.

> 💡 **Simple Definition for Students:**  
> Cloud is a collection of IT domains (networking, storage, compute, etc.) delivered on-demand via the internet using the Pay-As-You-Go model.

## 🚀 How Cloud Started
Before cloud, organizations managed their **own data centers**—buying hardware, setting up servers, hiring admins, and upgrading systems.  
This process was **expensive, slow, and inflexible**.

- **Then came AWS (2006)** with Amazon S3 and EC2, revolutionizing IT by renting out computing power and storage.
- Microsoft Azure followed in 2010, and Google Cloud Platform in 2008.
- Today, cloud adoption is a **default business strategy**.

## 💰 Pricing Models
Cloud providers offer multiple **billing models**:

| Model            | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Per Second**   | Pay for every second of compute. | AWS EC2 Linux (per second billing). |
| **Per Minute**   | Pay for each minute of usage. | Azure VMs (some sizes). |
| **Hourly**       | Charged for each hour block. | GCP Compute Engine (per hour). |
| **Daily/Monthly**| Fixed daily/monthly rate. | Reserved Instances, SaaS subscriptions. |

## 🆚 AWS vs Azure vs GCP
| Feature | AWS | Azure | GCP |
|---------|-----|-------|-----|
| **Launch Year** | 2006 | 2010 | 2008 |
| **Market Share (2025)** | ~32% | ~23% | ~11% |
| **Strength** | Broadest service portfolio, mature ecosystem. | Strong enterprise integration with Microsoft stack. | Best in AI/ML & Big Data. |
| **Learning Curve** | Medium | Medium | Easy |
| **Global Data Centers** | 102+ | 60+ | 40+ |

**Why Choose AWS?**
- Largest global reach (more regions & AZs).
- Most mature set of services.
- Industry standard—most job postings mention AWS first.

## 🔒 Cloud Security & Compliance
Cloud providers follow **Shared Responsibility Model**:
- **Cloud Provider** secures infrastructure (data centers, hardware, hypervisors).
- **Customer** secures workloads (apps, data, IAM policies).

AWS offers compliance with ISO, SOC, GDPR, HIPAA, and more.

---

## 🌍 Global Data Centers
- AWS: **Regions** → **Availability Zones (AZs)** → **Edge Locations**
- Azure: **Regions** → **Availability Zones** → **Edge Zones**
- GCP: **Regions** → **Zones** → **Edge Locations**

More regions mean lower latency and better disaster recovery.

## 🏗 Cloud as a Collection of Domains
Each domain existed **before cloud** in traditional IT.  
For example:
- **Networking**: CCNA → CCNP → CCIE → Network Admin → Network Manager → CTO.
- **Compute**: Windows/Linux Admin → Systems Engineer → Infra Architect.
- **Storage**: SAN/NAS Admin → Backup Engineer → Storage Architect.

Now, **all these domains have moved to the cloud**—requiring updated skills and certifications.

> - How it worked before cloud
> - Cloud version & services
> - Career path & job roles
> - Certification mapping
